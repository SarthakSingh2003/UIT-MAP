        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">"The final year B. Tech. project is defined as the development of a model or application (software or hardware) useful in exploring and/or solving an engineering problem".</h2>
            <p class="text-justify">These are guidelines for successful completion of the B. Tech. Projects in effective and uniform conduction of projects to be carried out by undergraduate B. Tech. Students in Semester VII and Semester VIII. It is expected that these guidelines will help in the overall improvement in the quality of B. Tech. Projects along with improvement in the evaluation process. The B. Tech. Project is a partial requirement for the successful completion of the degree. It can be two types: Projects based on implementing any application-oriented problem, which will be more or less experimental. The others will be based on some innovative (research-oriented) theoretical work.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">Department Evaluation Committee (DEC) is created to monitor the overall functioning of the activities related to the B. Tech. projects and to have an academic bridge among the various groups.</p>

            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Evaluation Procedure:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">To ensure proper conduction of each project, progress of each project should be monitored on a continuous basis, first by the supervisor and then by the DEC. In order to do so, it is planned to hold four presentations to be made by each project group in each Semester.</p>
            
            <h4 class="text-md font-semibold mb-2">First presentation:</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">The first presentation will be purely for approval of the project proposal presentation, which DEC will take in the first week of the VII semester. The project proposal is considered to be approved if it is passed in this presentation. If the presentation is not up to the mark, either the Committee will ask the students and their supervisor to modify the project slightly within a week and present again or change the project (in case the Committee finds the project not of sufficient standard or not feasible). In this presentation, the DEC is supposed to mark each student/group based on their project proposal content, presentation made, queries answered, and attendance out of 18 marks (Evaluation is performed according to Project Evaluation Rubrics) and send it to DEC.</p>
            
            <h4 class="text-md font-semibold mb-2">Second presentation:</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">The second presentation will be a purely synopsis presentation, which will be taken by an internal examiner appointed by DEC and scheduled by the supervisor. The project is assumed to be already selected by the students. In this presentation, they are required to show a brief presentation describing the main Aim/Objective of the project, division of objective into sub-objective, the methodology used, and implementation, which they will be pursuing. If the internal examiner is not satisfied with the presentation or feels that the project is not proceeding in the right direction, the same may be reported to DEC and their marks may be deducted.</p>
            
            <h4 class="text-md font-semibold mb-2">Third presentation:</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">The third presentation will be schedued after discussing it with the project Supervisor This presentation will be taken by an internal examiner appointed by DEC, all Supervisors, and co-supervisors prsent in their
                presentation. The Committee will review the progress of the students.Each
                group is required to make a project synopsis report showing the complete six
                month progress of the project. This report should be brief and mainly contains
                the detailed methodology/ algorithms adopted/ studies during the entire 
                Semester. This report should be signed by the supervisors and submitted to the DEC at least two days before the final
                presentation. The groups must also make a presentation (not more than 35-40 slides) and present it before the final
                Committee. In this presentation, the internal examiner is supposed to mark each 
                student/ group based on their project content, presentation made, project 
                progress queries answercd, and attendance out of 100 marks (Evaluation is 
                performed daccording to Project Evaluation Rubrics) and send it to DEC. 
                The DEC shall finalize the marks just after the third presentation. The 
                supervisor is also supposed to mark each student out of 8 marks (Evaluation is 
                performed according to Project Evaluation Rubrics). DEC add all marks with
