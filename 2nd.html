            <p class="text-justify">These are guidelines for successful completion of the B. Tech. Projects in effective and uniform conduction of projects to be carried out by undergraduate B. Tech. Students in Semester VII and Semester VIII. It is expected that these guidelines will help in the overall improvement in the quality of B. Tech. Projects along with improvement in the evaluation process. The B. Tech. Project is a partial requirement for the successful completion of the degree. It can be two types: Projects based on implementing any application-oriented problem, which will be more or less experimental. The others will be based on some innovative (research-oriented) theoretical work.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">Department Evaluation Committee (DEC) is created to monitor the overall functioning of the activities related to the B. Tech. projects and to have an academic bridge among the various groups.</p>

        <section class="mb-4">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Evaluation Procedure:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">To ensure proper conduction of each project, progress of each project should be monitored on a continuous basis, first by the supervisor and then by the DEC. In order to do so, it is planned to hold four presentations to be made by each project group in each Semester.</p>
            
            <h4 class="text-md font-semibold mb-2">First presentation:</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">The first presentation will be purely for approval of the project proposal presentation, which DEC will take in the first week of the VII semester. The project proposal is considered to be approved if it is passed in this presentation. If the presentation is not up to the mark, either the Committee will ask the students and their supervisor to modify the project slightly within a week and present again or change the project (in case the Committee finds the project not of sufficient standard or not feasible). In this presentation, the DEC is supposed to mark each student/group based on their project proposal content, presentation made, queries answered, and attendance out of 18 marks (Evaluation is performed according to Project Evaluation Rubrics) and send it to DEC.</p>
            
            <h4 class="text-md font-semibold mb-2">Second presentation:</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">The second presentation will be a purely synopsis presentation, which will be taken by an internal examiner appointed by DEC and scheduled by the supervisor. The project is assumed to be already selected by the students. In this presentation, they are required to show a brief presentation describing the main Aim/Objective of the project, division of objective into sub-objective, the methodology used, and implementation, which they will be pursuing. If the internal examiner is not satisfied with the presentation or feels that the project is not proceeding in the right direction, the same may be reported to DEC and their marks may be deducted.</p>
            
            <h4 class="text-md font-semibold mb-2">Third presentation:</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">The third presentation is the final internal presentation at the end of the VII semester. This presentation will be evaluated by the concerned supervisor with the help of some other internal examiner. This presentation is to ensure that project students should understand the problem definition, clear idea about their project, some initial implementation has been done (for hardware or software) and their work is going on in the right direction. In this presentation, students should demonstrate what they have done so far to DEC and explain their plans for next semester and confirm that they will be able to complete it in time. If students do not present their work as per the expected standard, then the DEC can take appropriate action.</p>
            
            <h4 class="text-md font-semibold mb-2">Fourth presentation:</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">The fourth presentation is conducted midway through the VIII semester. In this presentation, students are required to showcase significant progress in their project work, including the completion of major milestones. The focus of this presentation is to ensure that the project is on track for successful completion. The DEC and supervisor will evaluate the project based on the progress made, adherence to the timeline, and the quality of the work done so far. Any deviations from the plan or delays in milestones should be addressed, and corrective actions should be discussed.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-4">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Final Presentation:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">This is the final presentation, which is held at the end of the VIII semester. In this presentation, an external examiner appointed by the university will also evaluate the project work done by the students along with the DEC. The total marks for B. Tech project part I (VII semester) are 100 and for part II (VIII semester) are 100.</p>
            
            <h4 class="text-md font-semibold mb-2">Rubrics for evaluation of B. Tech. Projects:</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">To maintain uniform evaluation criteria, the DEC has framed project evaluation rubrics, which will be used for evaluating the projects. The project evaluation rubrics will be shared with all the supervisors and students at the beginning of the project work.</p>
