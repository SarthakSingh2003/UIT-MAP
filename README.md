# UIT-MAP
UITMAP is a comprehensive web-based application developed to streamline the process of maintaining project diaries for final-year students at the United Institute of Technology. By virtualizing the project diary process, UITMAP minimizes the need for students to physically visit the college for signatures and approvals physically, thereby enhancing convenience and efficiency.
The primary objective of UITMAP is to provide a robust platform that allows students to manage their project diaries online and enables admins to monitor and assess student projects seamlessly. The platform is designed to be responsive and accessible on multiple devices, including mobile phones and laptops, ensuring a smooth user experience across different platforms.
